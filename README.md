üìñ Project Overview
Determining employee salaries manually can be subjective, inconsistent, and time-consuming. This project aims to solve that problem by using a machine learning model to provide an objective salary estimate. The model is trained on a dataset containing various employee attributes and learns the underlying patterns to predict compensation accurately.

‚ú® Features
Predictive Modeling: Uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict salaries.

Data Preprocessing: Implements one-hot encoding for categorical features like 'Job Role' and 'Education Level'.

Model Evaluation: Calculates key regression metrics: R-squared (R 
2
 ), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Visualization: Generates a scatter plot to compare actual vs. predicted salary values, providing a clear visual assessment of the model's performance.

üíª Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks including model training, preprocessing, and evaluation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Google Colab: As the development environment.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
This project is designed to be run easily in Google Colab.

Open Google Colab: Navigate to colab.research.google.com.

New Notebook: Create a new notebook by clicking File > New notebook.

Copy & Paste Code: Copy the entire code from the .ipynb file in this repository.

Run: Paste the code into a cell in your Colab notebook and press Shift + Enter to execute it. The script will handle everything from creating the dataset to displaying the final results.

‚öôÔ∏è Code Walkthrough
The Python script follows a standard machine learning workflow:

Data Generation: A synthetic dataset is created using Pandas to simulate real-world employee data.

Preprocessing: Categorical data is converted into a numerical format using a ColumnTransformer and OneHotEncoder.

Data Splitting: The dataset is split into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set.

Model Training: A RandomForestRegressor model is trained on the training data within a Scikit-learn Pipeline.

Evaluation: The trained model makes predictions on the test set, and its performance is measured using R¬≤, MAE, and RMSE.

Visualization: A scatter plot is generated to visually inspect the model's accuracy.

Example Prediction: The script concludes by demonstrating how to predict the salary for a new, hypothetical employee.

üìä Results
The model performs well on the test data, indicating its effectiveness in predicting salaries.

Evaluation Metrics: The script will output the R-squared, MAE, and RMSE values. An R¬≤ score close to 1.0 indicates a strong correlation between the predicted and actual values.

üîÆ Future Improvements
Use a Real-World Dataset: Replace the synthetic data with a larger, real-world dataset for more accurate predictions.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the RandomForestRegressor model by tuning its hyperparameters.

Web Interface: Deploy the model using a web framework like Flask or Streamlit to create an interactive salary prediction tool.
